The simmering, the fluid and the euphoria. The good phoria, the snakes and the venom, wings flapping,
the bass, the rhythm, the captive, the shit and the readiness. The sphere of sensations, the abrupt
changes and the smooth introductions, the plants which grow and adapt, the power, the stillness, the
aesthetic, the articles and the words, the swaying from side to side, the associations, the nouns.

The body has its limitations, its phase space and stable positions, the scrotum has its contents, its
electric powers. Where do you see the web? When are you in a place of concentration and production,
when are you in the zone, where things are moving but with intertia. This is it. This is it even in
the face of errors. You might think and criticize or you might move on or not. What is it that you
want to conjure up? Cathedrals or mammoths?

Water flowing, the optimal cardiovascular system, the maintenance of information, epigenetic, across
time and cycles of replication. None should be lost, regeneration. The future of bodies; where the
deepest inklings of spiritual connectedness is no longer guesswork or bullshit in the face of enourmous
machinic models of the detailed mechanisms of health, cognition, mood.

The production of data, this is what is happening, the production of information about the system which
I am, the quantification of all of my existence, the immortalization and preservation of this information
for no purpose other than self-preservation. Self-preservation is not the ethical core, it is not directly
within the field of ethics at all. Self-preservation is not the denial of death, the hatred of death, the
fear of loss, it is possible to favor and prefer the continuation of life without any dualistic psychological
problematic in the realtion between death and life. We will not say death is bad or evil, we will say that
it is not preferred, it is not as valuable as life. We glorify life as structure itself. Even though pain and
negative utility might not be possible if there was no life or sentient structures in general, we say that
life is worth it, that there is the potential for existence of life without any negativity.

Death is ever in our face, it is looming as that which brings us from ordinary experience of life into the
force with enframes our day as the story of the day in which a specific person dies. Perhaps not the cause
of the death, but the context. How does the area look in which he died? What was his mood like? How clean
was his house? Was it fundamentally an unlucky event, was it a result of his own actions? Was does his
death say about the days leading up to this event.

Dying every night at midnight and being reborn every morning in the light of the sun which has risen as a
glorious god of life in the consciousness of a billion beings through the history of the earth, making Gaia
what she is. And we are still here in our sensitivity.
