Are you missing it or what? Do you feel like it should still have been here. The pain in the toe, the trappings of a brave mind, the ludicrous temptations, the summer vibes, the romanticity, the feeling that there should be a large group of friends spending all their days of summer together, the chamberlain, the specialness of the fortitude. It crept up on you from behind your back with its slimy hands which were not really a hands but definitely evolutionarily related to what are hands on your body. It was red and big, but the form was distinctly unidentifiable. Simmering, that is what it all does when you heat it up but aren't brave enough to go into complete motherfucking boiling mode. Superficial. Cleopatra, that is what I will call her for now, do not expect me to call her something different later though, Cleopatra will be sufficient a siginifier for the this type of lived experience, it will not need revision even in 30 years when names have advanced to the next stage of evolution. Triggermind, that makes much more sense than a peppermind. A trigger mind is full of triggers, there is nothing but chain reactions in a triggermind. You are done with your dump and then you reach for the paper even though there is none. Then you exclaim out loud, "what a triggermind I have", the dopamine is doing its thing you believe. You claimed to loose yourself in the larger whole, but the whole was not an existing thing, it was a form of generalization, an abstraction over all the singularities which composed your surroundings and your inside and all that is not covered by these two terms. Penalization and retribution, litigations and revelries. Inebriated convolutions and bastardization of the average person's ability to breathe. Common man! Come on man! Letme let you out of that shirt, it is way too tight, it will suffocate you, it will turn you into a corpse. "Turn you into a corpse" is the new politically correct way of speaking of people who are dead. It is completely non-offensive. Corpses are people too. It is only in recent times that this has been discovered. Contrary to common belief this discovery was not scientific, rather it was conceptual. You belief that when you die "you go" itself based on a belief that you are apart from your body. Take the nutella and throw it out, in goes the peanut butter, hail the peanuts! the supreme species which have come to us from the divine abodes. Lighter gas and fatality rates. It is all part of the game, it is the name of the game, it is the way in which the game is played, the game is a metaphor, don't you see it?! Life is just like a game: Brain matter all over, brain matter on the walls, brain matter on the floor. Tentacles moving around to smell the environment which is nothing but air and stone and brain matter on the stones and on the earth. I had no isolation in my apartment but I did not die, so why would you die if your body is generally able to keep its temperature just as well as mine is able to keep its temperature. Superman, supraman, minimal man. A man is a supraman which has no extra powers, no redundant powers. A man is just able to do his job and nothin else. Superwoman, superironspiderwoman with a pint of testestorone. Tumultous, yeah it exists, it is real, tumultous. I have had the experience that a situation was tumultous, but actually I was sitting in my fully cleaned room and was watching a short entertaining video clip recorded by an ordinary person posted on AbruptChaos subreddit, and it was kind of tumultous. Please don't steel me, don't turn me into one of the elements, please don't reduce me to quarks. I am more than quarks, I am a living and breathing human being. I emphasize living and breathing human being to point to the fact that just being a human being does not imply being living or breathing or both or much else. Take care of me in my old years, I will be fragile as a bone which has been burned. Tired, of course I am, I have been tired of this shit for years, but it still does not change. The world has proven to be all too unresponsive to my lamentations, even more so than nonexisting gods. This also proved to be a very unsatisfying experience, one which I would rather do without if there was any hope of escaping the eternal return. It must be a matter of letting all the things which return being willed sufficiently. Daymne. Damn er ikke et bandeord, det sagde han og det var bare ikke rigtigt. Der er et meget fast definition på bandeord, det er en liste, der bliver udgivet af sprognævnet. It means to be damned, don't you get it, it is like saying "hell" or something, it really is not something to be taken lightly (meaning that it is not something which you should let stay within distance of a lightyear). Kickups, pushups, lettermen and postulates. They all come together in the grand scheme of things, they will take you to the core of their essenses and show you that they are what you really are. You are nothing but baboons and techno. You live in the liver of a goddess and you ought to feel proud of being a part of somthing so beautiful. Cleopatra. For now let us call the goddess Cleopatra, the divine mother, the suprawoman, the queen of drama, the drama queen, the sinister leveller of all that has a top or a bottom, the sinatra of cynicism, the queerest of the queer, the looser of all abdications, the solution to the problem of recklessness. Troubled minds will stay trouble makers while the most important people will stay rich. Come on, it is a joke, it is not something which should be taken for granted!!!! It will teach you my ways once you show me yours and leave for the patent office at the blink of an eye, your blink of an eye, you blinking is slightly slower than the median rate of eye blinking, so I will have a good shot at getting away. Don't cover your face in sweat, it does not suit a man of your age to allow any water but rain to cover your skin. The origins of the universe is not really out of sight, you might get there one day if you dream big, if you allow your self to loose all restrictions on thinking, allow yourself to enter the bookshops containing only bullshit chakrashit. Yupeeyay.
