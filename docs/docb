What is the alternative to the current paradigm of networking? Server-based, rather than peer-2-peer.
It is natural for there to arise a kind of scale-free distribution with servers amassed on in datacentres,
The segmentation of root access in relation to human people with the power over the computation,
is established by company hierarchies and state surveillance capabilities.

Encryption is lacking, and the mode of networking is of political and even economic importance.
Information is amassing on servers funded by money from corporations, a small subset of humanity,
while many billion people are using it.

Maybe the current capitalist system is not at all optimal for fostering the development of truly
effective distribution peer-2-peer modes of networking.
