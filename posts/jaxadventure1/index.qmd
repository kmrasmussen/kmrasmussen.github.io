I have been wanting to learn more Jax, so I will go on an a Jax adventure.

```{python}
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp
import flax.linen as nn
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```
These imports should be sufficient for what I'd need.

I saw there is some kind of selfattention module in flax. Apparently Flax Linen is being taken over by Flax NNX

```{python}
from flax import nnx
my_selfattention = nnx.MultiHeadAttention(
  num_heads=2,
  in_features=10,
  qkv_features=6,
  out_features=12,
  decode=False,
  rngs=nnx.Rngs(0)
)
```
Okay now I have this object, I assume it is a nnx module. Usually then it has to be initialized with parameters separately, but why is there then an rngs associated with it?

```{python}
print(my_selfattention)
```
